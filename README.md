The code here relies pretty heavily upon the libtcod library. It can be found at:
  http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/


This code is currently untested under Windows, but should run easily under Linux by simply 
downloading the libtcod library and placing the files:
<pre>
  libtcodypy.py
  libtcod.so
</pre>

in the top-level directory and running:

<pre>
  ./python world.py
</pre>

from a command line
