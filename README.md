The code here relies pretty heavily upon the libtcod library. It can be found at:
http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/


This code is currently untested under Windows, but should run easily under Linux by simply 
downloading the libtcod library and placing the files:

libtcodypy.py
libtcod.so


in the top-level directory and running:

python world.py


from a command line
